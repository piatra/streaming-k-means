An attempt at a streaming k means algorithm in nodejs
* Ported algorithm from octave to javascript
* parser.c parses an input file with coordinates (from x,y,z to just x,y) into a javascript array; these are some old input files from a homework :)
* read.js reads that array and passes it to the clustering function
* the output is then drawn to the page with canvas (things are hardcoded here just just to see it's working)
